eh0770@att.com | 00:10
Yes, good to meet you.
Jeb Ory | 00:11
Hey, how are you doing, Eric? You too. Appreciate you making the time.
eh0770@att.com | 00:17
Sure, happy to do it. August is always a little slower, so it was perfect. It's good to get your email now rather than next month, so that's great.
Jeb Ory | 00:24
Awesome, definitely. Where do you live?
eh0770@att.com | 00:27
We live out in Northern Virginia, not far from Dallas.
So we go into DC. We're usually three days a week, but in August we actually closed down.
Jeb Ory | 00:33
Okay.
eh0770@att.com | 00:37
Can't believe our CEOs let us do it, but it's two or three years in a row now. He kind of lets us. We convinced him our entire audience is home, so why should we go in and do the kabuki.
So he lets us stay home, so it's nice, actually.
Jeb Ory | 00:48
That is nice.
eh0770@att.com | 00:50
Yeah.
Jeb Ory | 00:50
I live in Capitol Hill. We're a couple of blocks from the capital, Fourth and East Capitol. So.
eh0770@att.com | 00:57
Have you noticed any security presence difference since this thing, or is that all for show, or have you seen it?
Jeb Ory | 01:02
We haven't seen it yesterday or Monday. My wife went downtown, like, somewhere like Metro Center or whatever, and didn't see anything. I'm right now in Dupont.
eh0770@att.com | 01:12
Yeah, okay.
Jeb Ory | 01:14
Haven't seen any more presents.
So, I mean, we hope it's mostly for show, but it hasn't impacted our lives yet, so, yeah, but. But yeah, it's definitely newsworthy.
eh0770@att.com | 01:27
Good. Well, it's funny, my parents are both pretty moderate. They're voting, but they definitely over the last couple of years, they've asked me, "Hey, are you safe driving into work?"
So they've definitely seen stuff on the news because they're.
Jeb Ory | 01:44
He.
eh0770@att.com | 01:46
I've gone to Mexico City, I've got... And they're never worried about my security. They're worried about my drive to work. So it's definitely permeating.
Jeb Ory | 01:54
Know.
eh0770@att.com | 01:54
So.
Jeb Ory | 01:54
I read a letter to the editor in the Post this morning. That was from someone in Great Falls or Falls Church. And she was writing about how she's really excited about this because her perception of DC is that it's really unsafe, and she's scared to drive to museums and stuff.
eh0770@att.com | 02:00
Four.
Jeb Ory | 02:09
So clearly there's a narrative, right?
eh0770@att.com | 02:10
Yeah.
Jeb Ory | 02:12
So. And that's it's much more widespread. So inside the city, we may not be aware of the external narrative.
eh0770@att.com | 02:21
Well, it's only anecdotal, but I did shoot that carjacking where someone was killed.
Jeb Ory | 02:21
So.
eh0770@att.com | 02:26
I think it was last year near the arena. That did freak me out because I, you know, I always kind of said, hey, DC is bad.
But the crime stays at areas.
Jeb Ory | 02:34
Yeah.
eh0770@att.com | 02:36
You know, it doesn't come in white-collar areas, which is weird to say, but that did. It was one incident, but that was the first time I got like six o'clock.
Jeb Ory | 02:44
That was that weird Uber thing, right? Yeah, I remember.
eh0770@att.com | 02:47
Yeah, that was weird.
Jeb Ory | 02:50
Yeah, well, we're here, hopefully.
eh0770@att.com | 02:54
Yeah. There. I closed. Set up the edit.
Jeb Ory | 02:57
So I really appreciate making the time. So just by way of introduction, I had previously co-founded and built a company called Phone to Action. We worked with AT&T for years.
eh0770@att.com | 03:06
Fami good.
Jeb Ory | 03:07
We worked with Alex, Kolb and Margaret back in the day.
And anyway, that we merge a quorum in twenty two. And since then, I've done a variety of things, and I'm now sniffing around external affairs. I've been connecting with peers at highly regulated companies.
So, I've talked with people at Walmart, Philip Morris, Comcast, and Salesforce. It's a little bit different situation with what they do. Anyway, I'm developing a thesis around this world of spreadsheets and external affairs where there are lots of third parties and associations that you are funding and you're a part of.
There's a question that I'm hearing emerge about how do we determine where ROI is? Where should we put our energy? Let's say, some association isn't doing 25% of what we want them to do. Is it worth analyzing that and trying to push them along or whatever?
So, I wanted to... Before I go further, I just wanted to check and get your perspective. I love to get your background, and then we can talk more about that. Then I have a prototype that I'd love to get your take onto.
eh0770@att.com | 04:25
No, cool. It does it sounds interesting. My backgr just my background really quick is at well, I'll just 18 t you know, we're pretty big. I think compared to others, we're about 500 people on the team. My boss is TED Gillespie, who reports the CEO and he runs external legislative Affairs. Ed has, I think, five direct reports.
So most are lobbyists. I'm the one. So there's a I'll, Capitol I'll lobbyist, there's a kind of White House and administration lobbyist, there's a state lobbyist, and then there's me, I do kind of all the non lobbying.
Jeb Ory | 05:00
No.
eh0770@att.com | 05:01
So my world is third parties. It's advertising, it's media, NPR, digital war stuff, and that's where Alex reports up to me. Margaret used to... So, that's my world. I come from campaigns and other stuff.
So, this is a really good question. I'll answer your direct question in a second. It's funny because in terms of ROI, I think you're talking about something different. We struggled for a lot of years just with the general ROI for what we do, and we've done a lot of human non-machine computation of that.
Jeb Ory | 05:29
Yeah. Sure.
eh0770@att.com | 05:35
And funny at the Public Affairs Council and some of these things I go to, I do get asked because they hear we do it. So, a lot of companies have said, "Hey, could you just show us how you show that to the C-suite?"
So, that's what I thought you were going to ask about. This is interesting because I'm going through this. It really speaks to me. We have tried to do this again using humans. We give a lot to third parties, and I would say we probably give more or close to more than most companies.
That's frankly a bad habit. It comes out of, I think I believe in an old-school way of thinking, which is when we were really big at Fortune 100. We could just spread money around, for lack of a better term, especially with all the eminent we did over the last five years ago to 15 years ago.
Jeb Ory | 06:23
Yeah. Yes.
eh0770@att.com | 06:23
We did a lot of eminent with Warner and others, and we just gave out money, and as we've gotten... One had to do budget cuts and lay people off and two have a CEO and others who give us more discipline.
I've had a need to show real ROI, and it's hard.
Jeb Ory | 06:40
Okay.
eh0770@att.com | 06:41
And everybody from how do I measure, for lack of a better word, Al Sharpton, what is that worth giving him money or not, right? And we can all giggle about Al Sharpton, but he sits with me and the CEO, and I walk out of the room. I'm like, "All right, what do you want me to do?" Here's what I think. The RI is I can't measure it.
I've done polling on influence in Black America and corporate America and polling, but I can't tell you.
Jeb Ory | 07:05
Yeah.
eh0770@att.com | 07:05
And all these Republican groups right now, are they hitting Trump? Are they hitting Ron and people we care about?
So I've got a whole bunch of groups. That really is... I think it's informed, and I think it's somewhat more scientific than it used to be because I have people. They did this many op-eds, they got this published this many times.
But some way of helping me see that, sure would be helpful. For real, that's a big deal to me.
Jeb Ory | 07:33
Okay.
eh0770@att.com | 07:35
Yeah, they are, they kind are.
Jeb Ory | 07:35
Could you tell me about your team and how you guys view both association engagement and third parties? Which, typically, I've found, is third party would mean think tanks and nonprofits and associations, which are probably still part of the purview but not considered third parties.
But I don't know how you guys determine.
eh0770@att.com | 07:55
That's a good question. So we really do ascribe to the old Jim C1 as our old boss, who's a guy who I think we give him credit for coming up with this and Ed's adopted it. That, "Hey, lobbying needs an inside game and an outside game." Every time there's a lobbyist, when he leaves the office or she leaves the office, she needs here from three or four real people or real groups that say it.
So we put a lot of money into it. Millions and tens of not tens, probably.
Jeb Ory | 08:20
Zero.
eh0770@att.com | 08:20
Well, millions at least, millions over ten, probably when you look across, that's at the state level, too, not so much internationally.
So we really believe in it. Trade associations are important. I'd say this to you because we have to. I think we begrudgingly give money to trade associations. We're always frustrated with them like everybody else is, and because of that, I think we view them a little separate from third parties.
But it still comes out of my budget. I still give to the trades.
Jeb Ory | 08:48
Yeah, no, that's super informative.
eh0770@att.com | 08:49
We've backed out of it a lot more, and we've actually said the trades more and more. I'm not just writing you a check. I'll write you a $1 million a year check, but I'm not going to do it without knowing exactly what you're doing for me.
So try to be predictive. Then third parties. I have a team. This is probably not going to exist in two or three years. But I have a team. I have, for lack of a better term, a Latino woman who does Latina groups, Latino groups, a black woman who does other multicultural groups, including black groups, and a Republican woman who does it.
We pretty much do a budget in Q4 and say what we're going to do next year. We try to stick to it. We say, "Hey, this is why we're giving and how we're giving." We balance that out and give to probably 80 groups, I'd say, federally, including trade associations and then probably hundreds of groups at the state level.
But we're looking at changing that over time because traditionally, it's been Kansa clubs and maybe local chambers and maybe local AWS CPS and others, and that's just going to their meetings. We probably want to move that more to an influence model and see like, "Hey, these are the people who get kind of like we do in DC." "Hey, this group gets published or listened to by people close to Trump or Congress that we care about." I don't know if that answers your question, but that's kind of.
Jeb Ory | 10:15
So the things that matter with the third parties are what their output is, who they're influencing, and some of that is qualitative, some is quantitative or subjective and objective, right?
Because the like. So when you look at this. I mean, I'm imagining you have like a spreadsheet that your teams come in and say, okay, here are the people we want to fund. And it has, like, what, like the name of the org.
Like what heuristics do you look at when you make those decisions? What? What? What are the data points that are included?
eh0770@att.com | 10:48
Yeah, and I'll answer that in a second. One side thing to know is that we enlisted Gillespie's friend who said they could do a quantitative-qualitative study of who is most recognized by the White House. I was pretty underwhelmed.
But they tried to say who's published, who's read.
Jeb Ory | 11:05
Yeah.
eh0770@att.com | 11:06
They tried hard. I was pretty underwhelmed, but to your question, it is a spreadsheet. They bring it to me, usually in Q3, as we're thinking of Q4 again. I have the luxury of having a lot of people and consultants, probably if Margaret doesn't have this same ability, right?
Jeb Ory | 11:16
Two?
No.
eh0770@att.com | 11:23
But it says, "This is the group. This is how many op-eds they wrote, this is how many times they went to the Hill on our issue, this is how many meetings they had." It just says it all, right?
Then there's the column that says, "Here's how much we gave them." Judging by that and seeing the challenges of next year, in 2025, they worked on spectrum and tax reform. In 2026, they'll work on this first net federal contract and universal service fund reform, right?
So we think it translates to this. This is what we think they can do. These... Then there's usually a column that says, "Here's who they have legit relationships with," right? Not Chuck Schumer lets him in his office or Ted Cruz listens to them.
But it's kind of like it. I feel good about it, that the best humans can do, and it's my spreadsheet that humans try to argue with, and I will be critical. I'll sit there and say, "Well, does any of this matter?" Who read this study? They did. How many people really saw it? I saw they were printed in these three magazines, but does anyone read these? I saw they met with Trump, but did he really care about what they said?
Jeb Ory | 12:27
Yeah.
eh0770@att.com | 12:29
So we try to build a case of how influential they are. I think I have C plus to be minus comfort level in it. I think.
Jeb Ory | 12:37
Yeah. So, okay, so how many people are bringing in those spreadsheets to you or what does that full team look like?
eh0770@att.com | 12:44
Yeah, it used to be about ten or eleven people.
Jeb Ory | 12:45
How many people are adding info to those.
eh0770@att.com | 12:50
Now it's about five or six. And there's one person presenting it, but it's five humans building it. For me, it's actually the third-party managers, of which now there are five or six.
Plus, Alex Cobb or someone on his team helps them do the make it look pretty and be factual, right?
Jeb Ory | 13:10
Yeah.
eh0770@att.com | 13:11
That's how they do it.
Jeb Ory | 13:11
Okay. That is just the third parties. You said there are 80 federal and several hundred state and local ones.
eh0770@att.com | 13:22
That's just the federal ones for me right now.
Jeb Ory | 13:25
Okay.
eh0770@att.com | 13:26
State we do a very dumbed-down version of that in the states. I believe in the next year or two, I'm going to tackle that, maybe with you [Laughter] tackle that a little bit better. There's a lot of... Our state team, we are totally reworking
it. It's the last team we haven't shrunk down. It's the last team we have metrics to.
Jeb Ory | 13:43
Yeah. And the titles of your of this these five people are they external affairs like is that their title or.
eh0770@att.com | 13:53
Yeah, they all work under my team, and they're either called External Affairs or Public Affairs, but we changed that around.
Jeb Ory | 14:00
Yes, yeah, okay.
eh0770@att.com | 14:01
And their day-to-day job, again, this might change too, is babysitting. They are ambassadors to third parties.
That's their full-time job.
Jeb Ory | 14:09
And when they... How are they keeping track of all the meetings and engagements and stuff?
Are they using the system? Are they just writing it like.
eh0770@att.com | 14:20
Yeah. They're basically writing it down in a Word or Excel document and keeping it throughout the year, and they're probably not keeping meetings. They're using... We have a war room where Margaret and Alex used to work that compiles all this for us.
Jeb Ory | 14:32
Yeah.
eh0770@att.com | 14:35
It's a physical room of ten kids who put stuff together. So, they're basically, every week, tracking this. The op-ed showed up or this meeting happened. They're putting it in an Excel form. So, at the end of the quarter or the end of the year, I can see everything these third parties did Basically.
Jeb Ory | 14:51
Okay, cool. That's really helpful.
eh0770@att.com | 14:54
By the way, the one bug in the system that you can help me with is, you know, it's SPE and I would say especially with like multicultural groups who, frankly, we haven't needed or haven't been as active in this last year. How do I segment out? They had a conference where they talked about this for three seconds, the importance of spectrum versus an op-ed that appeared in Roll Call talking about spectrum in 500 words.
Jeb Ory | 15:21
Yeah, right.
eh0770@att.com | 15:21
So that's a big thing. I have to police a little bit.
Jeb Ory | 15:24
What's the value of what they did?
eh0770@att.com | 15:27
Yeah.
Jeb Ory | 15:27
And with the ASSO, the same thing, right?
eh0770@att.com | 15:27
And what's the spectrum? Not all spectrummensions are the same, right?
Jeb Ory | 15:32
And then with the associations, like, how do you track what you're. What they have promised to give you? For what? For what? You're paying?
eh0770@att.com | 15:41
We don't do this as well. So we do have the spreadsheet, same thing.
Jeb Ory | 15:45
Yeah.
eh0770@att.com | 15:47
But I would say they do more work than any of those other groups. But a lot of it is busy work, right? A lot of it is pretty stuff to send to us in some weekly report.
So I think there's still a challenge of how much impact they had. I'd actually say for the first time in a long time, I felt like CTI delivered more value than usual because there was a very specific wireless piece of legislation that they had very specific meetings on the Hill on.
So I'm tracking the Hill stuff, the very specific lobbying touches, so I could track that really well. I found that most of their PR and third-party work, traditional and my other world, was probably less effective and hard to track because it's like, "Well, we talked to this newspaper on background or we had a meeting at Commerce about this." That was just less hard to track. I don't know if that makes sense to you.
But that's. But we track the same way. But I think we're less effective at measuring it.
Jeb Ory | 16:53
Yeah, that makes sense. I think part of what I'm hearing is that there are all these different commitments and the opportunities for commitments from all these different organizations that need it right now in people's heads and in spreadsheets.
The question is, can we make that easier? So, I've synthesized some of the feedback, and I think I definitely want to incorporate yours into what I've done.
Now, with AI, it's really easy to generate a prototype.
It is crazy easy. Eric, this would have taken us lots of money and time.
eh0770@att.com | 17:21
Yeah.
Jeb Ory | 17:24
And I can do it in 30 minutes on Claude, not to downplay the value of this or anything, but it means that software is going to get easier and more affordable for enterprises to adopt, right?
So, what I'm going to walk you through is again, I preface that by saying there's no pride of ownership here. I'm more looking for feedback, not that this is the product. It's...
But I want to share that with you. So, I'm going to start sharing my screen. Okay? Can you see this? You can see.
eh0770@att.com | 17:58
Look like. Yep. Now I can... Yep.
Jeb Ory | 17:59
Okay, cool.
eh0770@att.com | 18:00
Great. Yeah.
Jeb Ory | 18:01
Okay. So the what I want to make kind of visible front and center on like a dashboard view is like total number of orgs.
And. And this may like I haven't figured out the best way to distinguish between associations and all third parties. That's one thing I know we need to adjust. But you know your total annual investment.
So then I want to bubble up the top organizations. Now obviously, for you, like CTI would probably be one of the top ones, right? But what we're able to do is take in... Think of it: we can basically import your spreadsheet, and that would populate a whole lot of this data.
Then we can show that there are some qualitative and subjective measurements about RI and health that we have a couple of different ways we would calculate. Obviously, I'd want to bring in the heuristics you're using, like OP-eds and things like that.
I think that's really important. The idea is that you can do periodic... The easiest way to do this is periodic surveys to the stakeholder that's in charge of that relationship. So, you're one of your affinity group. Folks would like you to do a three-minute survey or a ten-question survey each quarter on the relationship. This is a substitute, I think, for trying to get people to keep track of all the meetings live.
I've seen lots of companies try to do that, and it doesn't really work.
eh0770@att.com | 19:28
Two two.
Jeb Ory | 19:30
So, but a survey where you're measuring things might work, so I'll get into that in a second. So, this is one piece. Then, any individual organization you'd be able to go into and see your... This data would have to come from our clients, right?
But you could see a historical view of all the data. Then we have this thing called policy alignment, which I'll dive into in a second. Key contacts, some information about the organization, the relationship owner, this is on your team, and then there's an event calendar that shows what's coming up.
So, there could be events or speaking opportunities. So, envisioning taking all of those trade association commitments that have been made, right? And synthesizing all of that so you can see what's coming up and what you know, do you need to send an executive to this upcoming event?
It may just be the... You're above the fold maybe like CTI Chamber, and a few others. But there may be valuable opportunities that you guys need to send someone to or you can get some value out of that. You're not looking at...
Then this next piece is so I'll talk through this idea here. So this is policy alignment. So basically, we want to look at... We can look at with AI now all the organizations. So we could take all your ORGs.
So we start with your 80, right? We'd upload them and we would be able to obtain all of their publicly posted policy positions. Then we could take your company positions and we could analyze it so it looks something like this. We'd analyze your document and we'd be able to see it in real time. You can see how your policies are aligned or not aligned with all of the different stakeholders that you have. It would be as simple as taking your annual policy document or quarterly policy document, uploading it, and then we would be crawling and pinging the other websites of all of the published material of all of these organizations.
We can tell you in real time where the alignment is.
eh0770@att.com | 21:47
Interesting. That's great.
Jeb Ory | 21:48
Is that something you think would be useful?
eh0770@att.com | 21:49
Very.
Jeb Ory | 21:50
Or.
eh0770@att.com | 21:51
I think so, the answer is yes.
Jeb Ory | 21:53
Okay.
eh0770@att.com | 21:55
The challenge in the nerdy world... AI a lot of times on initial engagement, they have no stand because our issues are so stupid.
Jeb Ory | 21:59
No.
eh0770@att.com | 22:05
Like 2024, we had to inform a number of writa center groups.
Jeb Ory | 22:07
Yeah, yes.
eh0770@att.com | 22:11
What the heck spectrum was. So, this would still be effective. If you did a scan in December 2024, you would have found zero alignment just because they don't have any record of it.
But then by Q2, you could have this scan, and it would have refreshed and seen that they would have started publishing.
Jeb Ory | 22:26
Yeah.
eh0770@att.com | 22:29
So it's in the middle of a campaign. It's very effective. This would be great. This would be good. This.
Jeb Ory | 22:37
The one other element is tracking real-time of your third parties. What are they coming out with that could be relevant?
eh0770@att.com | 22:46
Yeah.
Jeb Ory | 22:46
And highly related to the overall analysis.
But, hey, is there a white paper that's relevant to you now? Things that you said are not reflected here, and I have a survey. Let me see if I can find it. I have a survey that I could walk you through.
It's a sample survey, but your points about the op-eds and some of those other touches, I would definitely want to incorporate into the ROI. Let me see if I can find this survey. I
may not be able to find it right now, but anyway, I want to anyway, but a survey that asked a couple of questions each quarter to get an update on how the relationships are going.
So, what is that missing that I just showed you? That would make it useful for your work, and how should I think about it?
eh0770@att.com | 24:03
Well, I have three. I wrote down three overall thoughts.
Jeb Ory | 24:06
Okay.
eh0770@att.com | 24:06
So the first is the only dumb hurdle to get on, and it is dumb, and I don't think you'll have a hurdle. There is still this...
So, we tried to build something like this manually five years ago, and there is my God, if the Washington Post ever got a hold of this.
Jeb Ory | 24:16
Yeah.
eh0770@att.com | 24:21
You scoring groups, you're talking about how influential...
I think we're past that now. Quorum and stuff that we've done before. Just know that you might get that pushback when you're selling this thing a year from now or two years from thought.
Jeb Ory | 24:32
Okay. Okay.
eh0770@att.com | 24:35
What it's missing...
I think this is hard to get, but someone like you may be able to figure it out. In addition to... So the measurements you're giving are awesome and really needed. There is a product need for this for sure. The one thing is measuring credibility, respect, or relevance.
If there's a way to figure that out, it would be great. There is a group called 60 Plus that we giggle about. There's a group called... There's some other group where basically if you give them something to do, they'll print it.
Everybody in DC knows that they don't have any influence because everybody knows they're fake. But your CEO sees it and he says.
Jeb Ory | 25:11
Yes.
eh0770@att.com | 25:13
We got it printed. That's good. There'd be a great way to measure, if you could ever figure it out, that part of the score is how relevant they are or how respected they are. That gets dangerous. I don't know how you do that, but that's something we always struggle with.
Jeb Ory | 25:25
Right.
eh0770@att.com | 25:28
Like, I'm going to give money to this group, does anybody really care what they say? Right? So that's something that, if you could ever crack that code, would be huge. Overall, I want to be your first customer. I would be a beta tester. I would give you Alex and his boss Katie to help you build this thing.
I think it's selfishly really important to me.
Jeb Ory | 25:51
Okay, yeah, great.

And important to me selfishly because I've got to rework the third party world from just this feeling right to data-driven and I actually have to shrink it too.
I think this would help us shrink that team so selfishly. Call me when you're ready to have a beta tester or you want some people to help you build your first client because I would pay for this for sure.
Jeb Ory | 26:16
Okay, that's amazing.
eh0770@att.com | 26:17
That's great.
Jeb Ory | 26:19
I mean, yeah, we're getting close to that. This is really helpful. What do you think? How do you think about pricing? Like what? What do you think that this would be worth if it does everything you want to do?
eh0770@att.com | 26:31
I'm being a weasel. You need to ask Alex and Katie. Because they do all this for me. And they come tell me why we should spend the money. So. I'm used to the model a little bit. They just bring in. Here's what we're paying for phone action or, hey, that's now going to be part of the Quorum suite of services.
Jeb Ory | 26:46
Yeah.
eh0770@att.com | 26:48
So some sort of licensing and, maybe special pricing if we how much time we help feed in to help you build it and whatever.
Jeb Ory | 26:54
Sure, yeah, that's fine.
eh0770@att.com | 26:57
But they... I'm being a weasel. I don't know. But I'd pay whatever Alex and Katie told me it was worth.
Jeb Ory | 27:03
Cool.
eh0770@att.com | 27:03
And you could negotiate it with them. And they would tell me what it's worth for sure.
Jeb Ory | 27:06
Yeah, that's great. I look, I will take you up on this opportunity. I think that this would...
Building for your complexity... I think it would be awesome and it would touch it. The Walmarts could use it, right? The McDonalds could use it. Like we were addressing a lot of very broad needs.
So I like that.
eh0770@att.com | 27:28
Yeah.
Jeb Ory | 27:29
So what I'll do is as we get a little bit further and some of a little bit more information synthesis. But I'll come back in a couple of weeks and say, yeah, let's go the next step and sit down and look at what kind of that initial engagement would work.
eh0770@att.com | 27:40
Great, it's great, yeah, I love it.
Jeb Ory | 27:45
So, yeah, you know what?
eh0770@att.com | 27:48
You're helping me solve a problem here. Hopefully, I help you solve a problem.
Jeb Ory | 27:52
Look, this would be great. It would be a great partnership. Eric, thank you. I really appreciate your time.
eh0770@att.com | 27:57
One other thing, C1 to action.
Jeb Ory | 27:58
Yeah.
eh0770@att.com | 27:59
I know you've said goodbye to your baby, but we... I got major kudos.
No one ever cared about C1 action in the company. Last year, that helped us drive a ton of action to the White House and other places. My CEO was like, over the moon about it. So, it was the first time I could show him specifically and it was worth his time that we moved people on large masses, both internally and externally.
Jeb Ory | 28:15
Really.
eh0770@att.com | 28:26
He, loved it.
So your baby helped me look good, too, so it was good.
Jeb Ory | 28:30
That's great, Eric. It's funny because I'll see things still pop up. I did a call yesterday with someone from the National Restaurants Association. I've been advising another very cool company called Clipbook, which makes media monitoring software.
This employee, Grant, had one of our old refrigerator magnets on his home fridge, and I'm like... So he showed it to me in the call, I'm like, "Yeah, no, it's nice, and I'm excited to get back in the game, so, yeah, all right, sounds good, Eric, thanks a lot, appreciate you.
eh0770@att.com | 28:52
That's funny, that's great. Well, good, well, thanks for sharing this with me, and I'll talk to you in a few weeks, maybe. This is great, thanks. All right.
Jeb Ory | 29:07
Okay, bye.
eh0770@att.com | 29:07
Bye. Bye.
